                        My name is Chevy McMartin. I graduated from Computer Programming at Conestoga College in May
                        2018. I'm currently looking to get my foot in the door as a developer.<br>
                        I'm always busy because I have two young children and a wife. I'm currently working as a
                        labourer to support my family and coding whenever I get the chance. I would love to have a
                        full-time developer position so that I can work on my craft and get paid for it!<br>
                        I'm like anyone else, I enjoy movies, video games, books, trips and adventures (even though I
                        don't do much of that anymore, being the sole provider for my family and looking for a better
                        job).<br>
                        I enjoy working on projects and coming up with solutions. I'm willing to work hard and do
                        whatever it takes to complete a job.

                <p>
                    I started working here through a temporary staffing agency. I got hired on full time after four
                    months. Three months later I was promoted to Quality Technician where I was in charge of making
                    sure all parts were up to standard. I was a Quality Technician for a year until I had to quit to
                    help my wife with the children because I was also going to school at the same time. After
                    graduating, I came back through another temp agency as a Machine Operator. Two months later, I was
                    promoted again to Training Facilitator. Unfortanetly that didn't last too long because they
                    cancelled my entire shift (weekend nights). So we all had to move to other shifts. I'm currently a
                    Machine Operator on the weekend days shift.

                    I worked through a temporary staffing agency until I was hired on directly by the company. I
                    trimmed and packed plastic parts. I quit because I started school in September (one semester in the
                    Physics program at the University of Waterloo. I passed the semester but didn't feel I was able to
                    stay in school for the next 6 or so years while taking care of a small family).

            <p>
                "Computer Programmer is a two-year diploma program designed for students who wish to learn the latest
                skills needed by business application developers in industry, but want to graduate sooner than allowed
                by the three-year Computer Programmer/Analyst program. The program emphasizes problem-solving skills
                using the latest versions of Microsoft, Java and open-source software to develop business and web
                applications. Object-oriented analysis, design, agile methodologies and programming techniques are
                mastered and applied throughout the program.
            </p>
            <p>
                Students learn through a combination of theory and practice, applying their knowledge to hands-on
                assignments and challenging projects. Complementary courses in areas such as mathematics, accounting
                and communications support the core IT courses. All of these skills are then applied to a capstone
                group project in the last year in which students build a major business application, providing them
                with experience of the complete application development cycle."

                            reservation, the first person in the waiting list will get the open seat automatically.

                            Refreshing my C# skills. This was a challenge given to me by teamtreehouse.com. I'm not
                            sure how they wrote their code, or if this is exactly what they needed, but it seems to be
                            right. This probably won't be on my portfolio too long because I'm going to be adding more
                            complex projects in the future.
